![Photo from our serie Rin Tohsaka from the anime serie Fate/stay night by SnC cosplay](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e6028b7b-4647-4bdb-945f-eceaffcd0464.jpg)

51 likes already on Facebook . . . . It might not seem a lot for some people but I love it that there are already 51 people liking this page. Simply became the fact there was no photo or " real" content yet. 

When I saw the the page like hit 50 I though this is just so awesome that I dragged myself to my Mac to process the blurred cover photo. 

SnC Cosplay was one of the few people I spoke about \#Cosboudoir after explaining our vision she is ver supportive about it and wanted to collaborate to build up our portfolio. 

This is a photo from our photo serie where she cosplays @Rin Tohsaka from the anime serie Fate/stay night.

Because this was the blurred cover photo I decided to process this one first. 

The rest of the photos from this photo serie will be processed and posted in the order that we had the shoot. 

I hope you all like this new concept.
